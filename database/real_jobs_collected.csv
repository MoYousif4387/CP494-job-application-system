We serve some of the biggest names in entertainment across attractions \& clubs with operations spanning 15 countries across North America and Europe.


Our global team of over 60 people, we operate as an independent entity within the larger Ticketmaster/Live Nation family. We set our own roadmap and operate a modern tech stack (i.e., Kubernetes, Docker, Flux and more!), all with the financial backing and resources of a Fortune 500 company. Free concert tickets are a cool perk too!


**THE INTERNSHIP**
